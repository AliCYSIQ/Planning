## top priority
3-4 hours of hunting or studying(bug bounty)

## mid priority
2h of game dev

## low priority 
- gaming for sometime
- 3d modeling



## How To Deal with priority
### For Top
- you never drop it under any pressure 
- it is the main thing and i should do it as i sleeping and eating
## for mid
- it is important things that i should do everyday that i like or it benefit me
- no drop in normal days
- i can drop it , if i really need time for exam or for top priority things (if i didn't do it and the day almost done)
### for low
- it is just things that maybe i will do it 
- i will drop it even in normal days but these things i like it , so it is more important than scrolling 
- if i need time for anything , it will be the first things will be drop
- i didn't add them to the plan because i do it when ever i  have time and nothing to do
